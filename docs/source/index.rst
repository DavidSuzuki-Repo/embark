What is Embark

Embark is a framework that allows you to easily develop and deploy  DApps.

With Embark you can:
* Automatically deploy contracts and make them available in your JS code. Embark watches for changes, and if you update a contract, Embark will automatically redeploy the contracts (if needed) and the dapp.
* Use any build pipeline or tool you wish, including grunt and meteor. (for 1.x, plugins coming soon for 2.x series) 
* Do Test Driven Development with Contracts using Javascript.
* Easily deploy to & use decentralized systems such as IPFS.
* Keep track of deployed contracts, deploy only when truly needed.
* Manage different chains (e.g testnet, private net, livenet)
* Quickly create advanced DApps using multiple contracts that can interact with decentralized infrastructure for storage and comunication.
